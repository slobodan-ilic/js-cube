# js-cube
JS lib for Second Order Analysis of [Crunch.io](https://crunch.io/) cubes

## Purpose
This is an attempt to create a light-weight library for manipulating the results (typically JSONs) generated by the [Crunch.io](https://crunch.io/) API.

## Implementation
The basic architecture tries to imitate that of the [crunch-cube](https://github.com/Crunch-io/crunch-cube) (the Python package for the same purpose).

## Current State
- Basic type resolution for CAT (Categorical) and MR (Multiple Response)
- Basic calculation of column-percentages for CAT x CAT

## Roadmap
- Add basic dimension types functionality (proper resolution for other types, hiding MR_CAT dimensions)
- Add row-, column- and table-wise direction percentage calculation for the common cube types (univariate CAT, MR, bivariate CAT x CAT, CAT x MR, MR x CAT, MR x MR)
- Try to come up with a POC, and see if it's feasible to use in production
