# js-cube
JS lib for Second Order Analysis of Crunch.io cubes

## Purpose
This is an attempt to create a light-weight library for manipulating the results (typically JSONs) generated by the Crunch.io API.

## Implementation
The basic architecture tries to imitate that of the crunch-cube (the Python package for the same purpose).

## Roadmap
- Add basic dimension types functionality
- Add row-, column- and table-wise direction percentage calculation for the common cube types
- Try to come up with a POC, and see if it's feasible to use in production
